## Abstract 
Diagnosis Experts Systems is one of the first and most ongoing Artificial Intelligence projects. The
agent-based diagnosis expert system for patients (DExS) is developed in this study based on an 
examination of the issues faced by current public health circumstances, such as the sharp 
increase in elderly patients, limited medical professionals, resources, and technology. [1]
The installation of the technology will improve the quality of treatment provided to patients. The 
establishment of the system will make medical condition diagnosis quick and straightforward 
while also assuring that the diagnosis is correct and dependable. Patients who want to learn 
more about their health.
## Introduction 
An expert system is computer software that mimics the decision-making abilities of a human 
expert. By doing so, it mimics the behavior of a human expert, using human knowledge to solve 
problems that would normally require human intelligence. Patients seek medical help for distinct 
reasons, including the diagnosis and treatment of various ailments. However, because many 
other diseases can cause fever, verifying the diagnosis of malaria can be difficult. It could be 
done to confirm a clinically suspected diagnosis or to gain more detailed information. Infection, 
for example, may signal the presence of malaria sickness in underdeveloped countries where 
malaria is widespread and is frequently associated with the "factor of development" known as 
poverty. Computer-based devices are rapidly being used to optimize the quality of medical 
services.
## What is a Diagnosis Expert System (DExS)?
Expert systems are databases designed to mimic (copy) the expertise and knowledge of a human 
expert on diverse topics. Human specialists' knowledge is entered and stored in the system. 
Users of the expert system can challenge knowledge. The system looks through its database for 
anything that matches the information given by the user. In the same way, as human specialists,
the expert system can provide answers to tough situations. [4] Diagnosis Expert System (DEXS) 
can substantially aid in the identification of diseases and the description of treatment methods 
while considering the user's ability to cope with and engage with the expert system simply and 
plainly.
## Conclusion 
Diagnosis systems are more popular among today's youth. The researchers used this information 
to create a knowledge-based Expert System for Medical Disease Diagnosis. The study's findings 
revealed that the system was well-received by the intended users and respondents. In terms of 
user acceptability, efficacy, quality, timeliness, and productivity, most target users and 
respondents are pleased with the system. Regrettably, most databases are proprietary and hard 
to obtain. Because some hospitals have already been employing computerized record systems 
instead of old paper-based systems, medical databases should have a bright future. Data 
generation for machine diagnosis should be simple. This method is generic, knowledge-based, 
and may be used to diagnose diseases with any rule-based expert system. We intend to expand 
the capabilities of our expert system by implementing more inference rules for semantic-based
knowledge representation in the future, as well as performing real user studies with patients and 
medical professionals.
